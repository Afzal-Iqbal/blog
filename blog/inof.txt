Non react website
A user types a URL in the browser and hits enter.

The browser sends a request to the server for that specific address.

The server responds by sending back a full HTML page.

When the user clicks a link (e.g., to a contact page), the browser sends a new request to the server.

The server returns a new HTML page for that route.

This cycle repeats for every navigation, resulting in multiple full-page reloads

Client-Side Routing




React Router DOM enables client-side routing, meaning navigation is handled entirely in the browser.
Instead of sending a new request to the server for each page, React intercepts the navigation and injects the correct component into the DOM.
2. Initial Load
The browser makes one request to the server.

The server returns:

A basic HTML shell

Your bundled React JavaScript files
React takes over from there.
3. Navigation Without Reloads
Clicking a link (e.g., /about) doesn’t reload the page.
React Router intercepts the click and renders the <About /> component inside your app.
This makes transitions faster and smoothe
